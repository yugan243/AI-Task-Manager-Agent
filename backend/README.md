# Backend Root

This is the root directory of the backend system. It serves as a modular system where `server.js` acts as the entry point that runs everything.

## Core Components

- **server.js**: The main entry point for the application.
- **routes/**: Defines API endpoints.
- **controllers/**: Handles business logic.
- **tools/**: Manages AI and external service logic.
- **utils/**: Contains helper functions.
- **memory/**: Stores temporary data.
- **logs/**: Records system events.
- **config/**: Manages configuration settings (work with `.env`).
